This repo will contain database-related projects

When to Use SQL vs. NoSQL

### SQL:
* Relational data with well-defined relationships
* Complex queries and reporting
* ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)

### NoSQL:
* Large datasets with unstructured or semi-structured data
* High performance and scalability
* Real-time analytics
* Flexible data models

Common SQL and NoSQL Databases
### SQL:
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Oracle
* SQL Server
* SQLite

### NoSQL:
* MongoDB
* Cassandra
* Redis
* DynamoDB
* Couchbase

## Example Projects
### SQL Project: E-commerce Database
* Create tables for customers, products, orders, and order items.
* Implement relationships between tables using foreign keys.
* Write SQL queries to retrieve customer information, product details, and sales data.

### NoSQL Project: Social Media Platform
* Store user profiles, posts, comments, and likes in a document-based NoSQL database.
* Implement features like user feeds, search, and notifications.
* Handle large volumes of data and real-time updates.
